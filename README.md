# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

This is Hand Gesture Recognition in Python using Mediapipe and Tensorflow

What is MediaPipe?
MediaPipe is a customizable machine learning solutions framework developed by Google. It is an open-source and cross-platform framework, and it is very lightweight. MediaPipe comes with some pre-trained ML solutions such as face detection, pose estimation, hand recognition, object detection, etc

To install, type "pip install mediapipe"

What is Tensorflow?
TensorFlow is an open-source library for machine learning and deep learning developed by the Google brains team. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on deep neural networks.

Neural Networks are also known as artificial neural networks. It is a subset of machine learning and the heart of deep learning algorithms. The concept of Neural networks is inspired by the human brain. It mimics the way that biological neurons send signals to one another. Neural networks are composed of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.

To install, type "pip install tensorflow"

We'll use OpenCV for Python to capture video

To install, type "pip install opencv-python"
